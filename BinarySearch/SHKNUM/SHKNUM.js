/**
 * Sheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer N. 
 * To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert N into an integer M that can be represented in the form 2^x+2^y 
 * (where x and y are non-negative integers such that x<>y). 
 * In order to do that, he can perform two types of operations:
 *  add 1 to N
 *  subtract 1 from N
 * However, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. 
 * Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert N into a valid integer M?
