Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.
Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.
Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as 

P1, P2, P3, and P4
â€‹
output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.
